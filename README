This project aims at creating development environments by exploiting virtualization in our desktops.

The project is part of a presentation: http://buzypi.in/project/desktop-virtualization/desktop-virtualization.html

Desktop Virtualization allows us to:
* Bring our development environment as close to the production environment as possible.
* Create a replicable deployment - verify everything before deploying to staging or production.
* Containerise functionality.
* Create a "Don't panic" environment for experimentation
* Eases provisioning for new employees.
